# Analyst Information Extraction Questionnaire

This project aims to create a questionnaire to evaluate whether analysts effectively extract relevant information from various types of documents, such as earnings calls or SEC filings. The following step-by-step plan outlines how to design, pilot, and analyze the questionnaire to gather valuable insights into analysts' information extraction processes.

## Objectives
- Determine how effectively analysts extract relevant information from different document types.
- Identify differences in the extraction processes for specific documents (e.g., earnings calls, SEC filings).
- Assess factors that influence analysts' abilities (e.g., experience, tools used, industry familiarity).

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Define Objectives
Clearly outline the goals of the questionnaire, focusing on understanding analysts' information extraction abilities and identifying influencing factors.

### Step 2: Identify Key Information Categories
Break down document types into relevant information categories:
- **Earnings Calls**: Key financial metrics, forward guidance, management tone, etc.
- **SEC Filings**: Compliance information, risk disclosures, financial ratios, executive compensation, etc.

### Step 3: Design the Questionnaire Structure
Design the questionnaire with the following sections:
1. **Demographics and Background**: Analyst experience, industry focus, tools used.
2. **Document Familiarity and Usage**: Familiarity with document types and frequency of use.
3. **Information Extraction Evaluation**: Areas of information that analysts focus on.
4. **Effectiveness and Challenges**: Analysts' perceived effectiveness and challenges faced.
5. **Open-ended Insights**: Additional comments or suggestions.

### Step 4: Develop Questions
Create specific questions for each section:

#### 1. Demographics and Background
- What is your level of experience as an analyst?
- What industries do you cover?
- Which tools do you use to analyze documents?

#### 2. Document Familiarity and Usage
- How often do you use the following document types? (e.g., Earnings Calls, SEC Filings)
- Which documents are the most useful for extracting relevant information?

#### 3. Information Extraction Evaluation
- For **Earnings Calls**, which information do you extract? (e.g., Revenue trends, Tone of management)
- For **SEC Filings**, which sections do you extract information from?
- How would you rate your ability to extract relevant information from each document type?

#### 4. Effectiveness and Challenges
- How confident are you in the completeness of the information you extract?
- What challenges do you face in extracting relevant information? (e.g., Volume of content, Complexity of language)
- Do you face challenges in determining relevance within these documents?

#### 5. Open-ended Insights
- How could the information extraction process be improved?
- Are there any specific tools or strategies that could enhance the analysis process?

### Step 5: Choose Question Format
Use a mix of **multiple-choice questions**, **rating scales** (Likert scales), and **open-ended questions** to gather structured data and personal insights.

### Step 6: Pilot the Questionnaire
- Conduct a pilot survey with a small group of analysts.
- Gather feedback on clarity and relevance of questions.
- Adjust the questionnaire based on pilot feedback.

### Step 7: Distribute the Questionnaire
- Use online platforms (e.g., Google Forms, Typeform) to distribute the questionnaire.
- Target a representative sample of analysts from various industries and experience levels.

### Step 8: Analyze Responses
- Summarize quantitative results (e.g., frequency of document use, rating scores).
- Perform qualitative analysis on open-ended responses.
- Cross-reference experience and industry focus with effectiveness ratings.

### Step 9: Derive Insights and Recommendations
- Identify which documents and sections are most challenging.
- Determine areas for improvement in training, processes, or tools.
- Generate recommendations to optimize document analysis workflows.

### Step 10: Report Findings
- Summarize key findings to communicate insights to stakeholders.
- Highlight opportunities to enhance extraction processes, address challenges, and improve document analysis tools.
