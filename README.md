# Research Project: Assessing the Quality of Financial Analysts

## Overview

Welcome to the "Assessing the Quality of Financial Analysts" research project! Students will work alone, creating different questionnaires for different industries and document types. They will be provided with the necessary documents and informed about the industry they will be analyzing. This project will be conducted at the Chair of Banking and Finance at Goethe University Frankfurt. This project is focused on creating a questionnaire to assess the quality of a financial analyst, similar to the CFA. The questions will evaluate how well an analyst can extract relevant information from given data, which could include single choice, multiple choice, or free text responses. The questionnaire must be verified to ensure its reliability. To achieve this, students will use different document types (e.g., Analyst Reports, Earnings Call Transcripts, 10-K or SEC files) as sources for the questions.

After creating the questionnaire, students will have different large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, answer the questions based on the given documents. They will then assess the accuracy of these LLMs and benchmark them against each other for comparison.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are:

1. **Create** a questionnaire to assess the quality of a financial analyst in extracting relevant information from given data.
2. **Verify** the reliability and validity of the questionnaire using various document types.
3. **Evaluate** the performance of different LLMs in answering the questionnaire and **benchmark** their accuracy against each other.

## Scope

This research is intended for bachelor students who are interested in:

- Financial analysis, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.
- Learning how to create and validate assessment tools, analyze data, and compare AI model performance.

## Methodology

We will use the following methodologies:

1. **Questionnaire Design**: Developing questions that assess the ability to extract relevant information from financial documents.
2. **Document Analysis**: Utilizing Analyst Reports, Earnings Call Transcripts, 10-K, or SEC files as sources for developing questions.
3. **Verification**: Testing the questionnaire to ensure its validity and reliability.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Using LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama) to answer the questionnaire and evaluating their performance.
5. **Benchmarking**: Comparing the performance of different LLMs against each other.
6. **Reporting**: Writing a detailed report summarizing our conclusions and recommendations.

## Expected Outcomes

- A verified questionnaire that assesses the quality of a financial analyst in extracting relevant information.
- A comparative analysis of different LLMs based on their accuracy in answering the questionnaire.
- A written research paper or report summarizing key findings.
- A presentation to share insights with peers and stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies

- **RAG Codes**: GitHub will contain RAG-codes to query LLMs (Llama, Gemini, GPT) for creating benchmarks.
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R.
- **Collaboration Tools**: GitHub, Google Drive.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Excel.
- **Language Models**: ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama.

## How to Contribute

Bachelor and master students are encouraged to contribute by:

1. Developming the extensive and creative **industry-specific list of questions** to test the quality of answers provided by different LLMs enhanced with RAG alorithm comparing with initial respective LLMs. As an example, a list of questions from the CFA Level III exam can be considered.
2. Proposing the **adjustments for the codes** with the existing RAG algorithms that would make the process more efficient.
3. Being active in the **discussion forum in the GitHub classromm**.

## Getting Started

1. Read the readme files in the "GPT_RAG", "Gemini_RAG", and "Llama_RAG" folders.
2. Follow the instructions from the .ipynb files in the respective folders. In one of the first steps there is a link that will open the code in colab.
3. Execute the code cell by cell. Ask ChatGPT to help if you encounter an error.
4. You will have to load the data to the "data" folder that will be created in colab. The analyst reports are available in Dropbox (please find the links in the Excel file with the Topics Allocation). You will have to download SEC filings and Corporate Eranings Calls in the data room. Please follow the instructions.
5. Insert the questions you created to the respective cells of the code and save the textual output.
